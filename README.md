## Kubernetes hardening
* Secure EKS Cluster
  * Cloud Infrastructure Security
  * VPC Layout
  * Dedicated IAM Role for EKS Cluster Creation
  * Cluster Resource Tagging
  * Control SSH Access to Nodes
  * EC2 Security Groups for Nodes
  * Don’t Install the Kubernetes Dashboard
  * AWS Fargate for Nodeless EKS (AWS does not recommend running sensitive workloads on Fargate.)
  * IAM Policies and the Principle of Least Privilege( cluster autoscaler by using the IAM policy Condition)
  * Isolating Critical Cluster Workloads
  * Manage IAM Credentials for Pods
* Authentication
  * --anonymous-auth=false (Default:true)
  * To enable X509 client certificate authentication to the kubelet's HTTPS endpoint
* Authorization (RBAC, Node, ABAC or Webhook)
  * –authorization-mode is not set to AlwaysAllow, as the more secure Webhook mode will delegate authorization decisions to the Kubernetes API server.
  * Do not grant write access to ConfigMaps in ClusterRoles, which apply globally across all namespaces. Use RoleBindings to limit these permissions to specific namespaces.
* Admission Control
  * Gatekeeper
  * Enable NodeRestriction admission plugin to limit a kubelet to modify its own node) pods and pod status
  * AlwaysPullImages
  * DenyEscalatingExec
  * ResourceQuota
  * LimitRanger
* Pod security. Admins can control specific actions.
  * Pod security policy
  * Restrict the containers that can run as privileged (Delete the default pod security policy)
  * Do not run processes in containers as root
  * Do not allow privileged escalation
  * Restrict the use of hostPath or if hostPath is necessary restrict which prefixes can be used and configure the volume as read-only (By default pods that run as root will have write access to the file system exposed by hostPath) prevent symbolic links threat
  * Set requests and limits for each container to avoid resource contention and DoS attacks
Quality Of Service (QoS)
  * Privileged: false
  * runAsUser:    rule: 'MustRunAsNonRoot'
  * AllowPrivilegeEscalation=false
* Multi-tenancy
  * Namespace / RBAC
  * Node selector
  * Anti-Affinity Rules
  * Taints / Tolerations
* Network security
  * Network policies. The default is that all pods talk to all pods. Consider changing it.
  * Traffic control
  * Network Policies (Calico)
    * Create a default deny policy
    * Create a rule to allow DNS queries
    * Incrementally add rules to selectively allow the flow of traffic between namespaces/pods
    * Log network traffic metadata
    * Use encryption with AWS load balancers
  * Security Groups
  * Encryption in transit
  * Service Mesh
  * Container Network Interfaces (CNIs)
  * Nitro Instances
* Kubernetes secrets. Use secrets to store sensitive data instead of config maps.
* ETCD
  * PKI-based authentication for etcd
  * Encryption at rest
  * etcd peer-to-peer TLS
  * Kubernetes API to etcd cluster TLS
* Image Security
  * Private registries
  * Image signing (use only signed images from trusted registry)
  * Image vulnerability check
* Container security
  * Dockerfile
  * Do not expose the Docker daemon socket
  * Set a non-root user
  * Add –no-new-privileges flag
  * Prevent Docker in docker (DIND)
  * Docker Bench for Security
  * Preventing containers from loading unwanted kernel modules
    * /etc/modprobe.d/kubernetes-blacklist.conf
* Runtime security
  * SELinux
  * AppArmor (EX: enforce AppArmor profiles on pods via Pod Security Policies. Prevent the attack pods from writing to files in the host’s filesystem)
  * Seccomp 
  * Falco
* Detective Controls (Audit logging. Watch them!)
  * Auditing and logging
  * Enable audit logs
  * Create alarms for suspicious events
  * Analyzing Log Data with CloudWatch Logs Insights
  * Audit your CloudTrail logs (IRSA)
  * Falco log
  * Audit all the container's activity
* Infrastructure Security
  * Use an OS optimized for running containers
  * Treat your infrastructure as immutable and automate the replacement of your worker nodes
  * Periodically run kube-bench to verify compliance with CIS benchmarks for Kubernetes
  * Minimize access to worker nodes
  * Deploy workers onto private subnets
  * Run Amazon Inspector to assess hosts for exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices
  * Harden the host (always patch)
  * Separate partitions for containers
* Defense
  * Don’t allow privileged Pods
  * Don't allow a container to become root
  * Don’t allow host mounts at all
  * Consider a network plugin or Network Policy for segmentation
  * Only use images and registries that you trust and don’t rely on Docker Hub as a trusted source
  * Keep roles and role bindings as strict as possible
  * Don’t automount Service Tokens into Pods if your services don’t need to communicate to the API
  * Consider abstracting direct console access to the cluster away (ie Terraform, Spinnaker) so that none of your developers have cluster-admin permission.
